# DGL Individual Coursework

Exploring how graph neural networks (GNNs) can be used for different tasks. \
The Coursework's main tasks include:

1. [**Graph-Based Classification**](q1_graph_classification.ipynb): implementing a GNN that can classify entire graphs while dealing with an interesting dataset. Exploring different graph-level aggregation techniques, analyzing class distributions, and experimenting with ways to improve model performance.

2. [**Node-Based Classification in a Heterogeneous Graph**](q2_heterogeneous_node_classifcation.ipynb): designing a GNN that can correctly classify nodes of different natures and feature dimensions inside a single graph, all while considering their heterogeneity.

3. [**Investigating Topology in Node-Based Classification**](q3_topology.ipynb): analysis of how the structure (or topology) of a graph affects the performance of GNNs by exploring key graph measures such as node degree, modularity, and Ollivier-Ricci curvature and examining their impact on model performance.
